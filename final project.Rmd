## Choosing the top three and bottom three albums
```{r}
# 1. Top 5 albums with highest Metacritic score
top_5_metacritic <- taylor_albums %>%
  arrange(desc(metacritic_score)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(metacritic_score)) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  select(album_name)

# 2. Bottom 5 albums with lowest Metacritic score
bottom_5_metacritic <- taylor_albums %>%
  arrange(metacritic_score) %>%
  filter(!is.na(metacritic_score)) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  select(album_name)

# 3. Top 5 albums with highest user score
top_5_user <- taylor_albums %>%
  arrange(desc(user_score)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(user_score)) %>%  
  slice(1:5) %>%
  select(album_name)

# 4. Bottom 5 albums with lowest user score
bottom_5_user <- taylor_albums %>%
  arrange(user_score) %>%
  filter(!is.na(user_score)) %>%  
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  select(album_name)

# Find the intersection of top 5 Metacritic and top 5 user scores
top_intersection <- top_5_metacritic %>%
  semi_join(top_5_user, by = "album_name") %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  select(album_name)

# Find the intersection of bottom 5 Metacritic and bottom 5 user scores
bottom_intersection <- bottom_5_metacritic %>%
  semi_join(bottom_5_user, by = "album_name") %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  select(album_name)

# Print the intersections
print(top_intersection)
print(bottom_intersection)

# Top 3 are Red (Taylor's Version), folklore, evermore, 
# Bottom 3 are reputation, Fearless, 1989

# Note: Here we take into account both the metacritic_score and user_score for 
# deciding which are top three and bottom three.

## Cleaning the data (Melisa)

## Checking Numerical Correlation (Kristine)
```{r}

```

## Checking Categorical correlation (Sandrina)
```{r}

```

## Checking Logical correlation (Salman)
```{r}
# The logical features are: ep, bonus_track, explicit
# I think the logical correlation can't be computed for this dataset because the
# score is based on albums and the features is based on songs, say I aggregate the
# features for each album, then it will becomes numerical feature instead of categorical
# Looking at the taylor_albums dataset, it's also impossible to do correlation test 
# since the data for TRUE ep has missing value for metacritic score and user_score
```
